"Where band housing is present, total dwelling counts are larger than the sum of owned and rented dwellings."
"The primary household maintainer is the person or one of the people in the household responsible for major household payments such as the rent or mortgage. In households with more than one maintainer, the primary maintainer is the first person listed as a maintainer."
